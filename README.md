## Installing and running the game

To run Think Green, you need two thing installed:

*   Python 2.7 – Python is a general-purpose programming language.
    Python is installed by default on almost every Linux distribution,
    but if you use Windows or Mac OS you'll probably need to install it
    yourself. Just head on over to http://www.python.org/download/
    and grab the Python 2.7 installer for your operating system.

*   Pygame – Pygame is a library (pre-packaged code) that makes it
    easier to program games. If you use a Linux operating system, your
    distribution probably has a package for Pygame. If you're using
    Windows or Mac, head to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
    and grab the correct installer for your operating system. (Make sure
    it's one that has "py2.7" in the filename.)

You can test whether Pygame is installed correctly by opening the Python
interpreter and typing

    >>> import pygame

If this doesn't print any errors, then you should be good to go.

Once you have Python 2.7 and Pygame installed, you need to obtain the
Think Green game files. If you know how, just clone this repository.
Otherwise, download a .zip archive of the repository using this link

    https://github.com/kalgynirae/thinking-green/zipball/master

and extract the files to an easy-to-access folder.

Run the game by executing think-green.py with Python. On Linux or
Mac OS, you can open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing
think-green.py, and type

    python think-green.py

On Windows, you can probably just double-click the file to run it.
