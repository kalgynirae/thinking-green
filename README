Think Green is an environmentally-friendly game for Python 2.x and
pygame!

GAMEPLAY TIPS:
 * Score points by neutralizing hazards.
 * Chain up recycles in front of receptors to get extra combo points!
 * Survive for as long as possible.

To run, simply clone the git repository or download and extract a zipped
version, and then execute

    python think-green.py

Thinking Green requires pygame (and thus Python 2.x). If you're running
a Linux-based OS, your distribution probably provides a package for
pygame. If not, or if you're on Windows, download pygame from:
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

If you find you have to install pygame manually, here are a few tips:
 * Make sure the pygame directory is on your Python path. Usually Python
   provides a directory called "site-packages" for this sort of thing.
